# Prime Finder

Finds all the prime numbers up to the user specified number.

Found this while cleaning up an old server. Wrote it back in 2011. Rather surprised that this code is not completely appalling. Most of my code I look back on, makes me very sad and wonder what I was thinking.

### Example output:

```
$ ./primefinder
Up to what number do you want to find prime numbers? 5
Finding up to: 5
Prime: 2
Prime: 3
Prime Count: 2
```


## Usage

```
gcc primefinder.c -o primefinder
./primefinder
```
